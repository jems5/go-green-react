1. Rework on the skills section

- sort out the loading of the bar graph
- sort out the running numbers in the stats container

Fixed List

1. Pricing section hover button not working

- suspect it's because inline styling
- might need to restructure the data array

2. Rework on the skills section

- consider using the same approach as Pricing component
- define the graph component first, call the component again in the return statement together with the copywriting

3. Rework into the dotted lines underneath headers

- pricing and footer are ok
- set position at the header, add padding to the header and move the dotted lines accordingly
- might need to look into how to make the dotted lines responsive as well, maybe using calc() to get the accurate placement

Notes:
if you're using vite (which is our case), you need to handle env files using import.meta.env

if using cra, then handle using process.env

if hover effect goes away instantly after cursor leaves, apply transition to base element as well
